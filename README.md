Year2: Programming2 module: Coursework2: Java implementation of whist card game

Java implementation of the card game whist.
Additional task was to attempt a better strategy. 
This was attempted by predicting the remaining cards in the other player's hands, however the implemented 'overcautious-approach' proved to be less effective 
(approximately 10% less games won using this method vs standard emulated players)
